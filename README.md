# NoSnoozeNET
Fully customizable Alarm clock that Auto Snoozes until you're finished doing what you're doing.

## For what purpose?
NoSnooze aims to help you keep your schedule by letting you finish what you're doing, instead of making you either snooze your alarm and forgetting about it afterwards.
I suddenly got this idea when planning a study schedule for myself, then completely forgetting about it that same day.
I soon got to work on idea-crafting, and I aimed to make it a simple, yet powerful tool to use.
At the time of writing this, it's still a very early project, but I plan to extend it as much as possible.

## Wanna contribute?
We are looking for more contributors, and more experienced individuals for specific parts of the program. If you want to contribute, fork this project and commit your work via pull requests.
